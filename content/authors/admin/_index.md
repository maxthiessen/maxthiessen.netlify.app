Hey, my name is Max. I am a PhD student supervised by [Prof. Thomas Gärtner](https://thomasgaertner.org/) in the [machine learning research unit](https://ml-tuw.github.io/) at TU Wien, Austria. Before that, I studied computer science at the [University of Bonn](https://mlai.cs.uni-bonn.de/) under the supervision of [Dr. Tamás Horváth](https://mlai.cs.uni-bonn.de/people/tamas-horvath). My main research interest is *active* and *semi-supervised learning*. The goal is to achieve novel *sample* and *query complexity bounds* for learning tasks on graphs using *convexity theory*. Additionally, I am working on *graph representations* that go beyond the *Weisfeiler-Leman* isomorphism test.
