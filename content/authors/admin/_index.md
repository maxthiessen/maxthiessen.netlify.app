Hey, my name is Maximilian Thiessen and I am PhD student in machine learning at TU Wien, Austria. I am interested in active and semi-supervised learning. In particular, I want to use convexity theory to achieve novel sample and query complexity bounds for learning tasks on graphs. Additionally, I am working on new efficient graph kernels.
